program itterates through 5 promps. each promp has something it does
1. write
2. display
3. load
4. save
5. quit

the main function will run on a while open loop that when you input quit will close the loop.

1. write will start with getting the date and a random question promp from a list of questions. It will then take user input for the journal entery and save to a string.
2. this will display the string of the journal entrys
3. load will copy over text from a user inputed document onto the journal string
4. this will save and overwrite a user inputed document
5. will close the main loop

I need at least 2 classes

class 1 will be the journal class
> does something with list of entrys ...
> can load over other file with load
> can save a file by asking for a file name then saving it
> can display journal and previous entrys


class 2 will be the entrys
> string with date
> contains the list of questions
> function that gets a random number
> takes user input
